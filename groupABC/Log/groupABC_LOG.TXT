*-- Shaft Design -- *

The following input parameters were selected: 
Axial force = 25 N.
Shaft length = 10 mm.
There will be 50 kg of total weight hung at the end of the beam.
 
The following design outputs were found after the analysis and optimization steps were performed: 
Optimized shaft diameter = 13.46 (mm).
 
The following assumptions were made for the beam design calculations: 
The shaft is made of 1100-0 Aluminm alloy.
There is no torque loading on the shaft.
